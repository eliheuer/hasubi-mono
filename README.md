Hasubi Mono (ÿ≠ÿßÿ≥Ÿàÿ®Ÿä ŸÖŸàŸÜŸà) is an Arabic, Hebrew, and Latin condensed horizontal-contrast monospace typeface designed by Eli Heuer. Hasubi is a transliteration of ‚Äúÿ≠ÿßÿ≥Ÿàÿ®Ÿä (my computer).‚Äù

A PDF print specimen in avaiable [here](documentation/drawbot/hasubi-mono-print-proof.pdf).

# Design Notes
Hasubi Mono has a few unique features that need some explanation, such as horizontal contrast and the GAPS axis.

## Horizontal Contrast
Hasubi mono was designed specifically for people who work with Arabic and Hebrew in text editors and terminals. Because the whole typeface shares a horizontal-contrast based drawing style that originates from the Arabic, the font is extremly condensed allowing a terminal user to make better use of screen space, or a designer to fit more text into a small space. See the below image comparing Hasubi Mono with Input Mono Compressed as an example. Note that Input Mono Compressed is one of the narrowest monospace fonts avaiable today, so the fact that Hasubi Mono is slightly more narrow while also including the Arabic alphabet should be somewhat impressive once the design problems around fonts like this are fully understood.

## Gaps Axis
Note that the Arabic glyphs in this font have gaps, in the variable font version of this typeface there will be a GAPS custom axis that interpolates between open and closed gaps. This style is inspired by the look of Arabic printing in older books printed with metal type. Specifically the book [Materials for the Study of the B√°b√≠ Religion](https://archive.org/details/materialsforstud0000brow) published in 1918 by Cambridge University Press, which the designer of this typeface read while learning Arabic and noticed that the gaps were helpful for a beginner Arabic reader.
