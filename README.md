Hasubi Mono (حاسوبي مونو) is an  condensed horizontal contrast monospace typeface designed by Eli Heuer. Arabic, Hebrew, and Latin scripts are included. This typeface was specifically designed for people working with a mix of RTL and LRT scripts in text editors and IDEs. Hasubi is a transliteration of “حاسوبي (my computer)” in Arabic.

* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://eliheuer.github.io/hasubi-mono.
