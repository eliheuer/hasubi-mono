## üöß WARNING! üöß This font is under construction!

### This is an alpha quality pre-1.0 typeface, not ready for use and currently under development.

Hasubi Mono (ÿ≠ÿßÿ≥Ÿàÿ®Ÿä ŸÖŸàŸÜŸà) is a condensed horizontal contrast monospace typeface designed by Eli Heuer. Arabic, Hebrew, and Latin scripts are included in the font, and all scripts are designed to share the same horizontal contrast as the Arabic. Hasubi is a transliteration of ‚Äúÿ≠ÿßÿ≥Ÿàÿ®Ÿä (my computer).‚Äù

## Design Notes
Hasubi Mono has a few unique features that need some explanation such as horizontal contrast and the GAPS axis.

### Horizontal Contrast
Hasubi mono was designed specifically for people who work with Arabic and Hebew in text editors and terminals. Because the whole typeface shares the horizontal contrast from the Arabic, the font is very condensed at it's default width. See the below image comparing Hasubi Mono with Input Mono Compressed.

### Gaps Axis
Note that the Arabic glyphs in this font have gaps, in the variable font version of this font there will be a GAPS custom axis that interpolates between open and closed gaps. This is inspired by printing in older [books](https://archive.org/details/materialsforstud0000brow) make with metal type.
